Hi,
I have stacked all the presentations that I gave, from my undergrad to my master's.
I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science from St.Francis College for Women's. My undergraduate final project was on consumer behavior during purchases.
I completed my Master's in Biostatistics from Manipal Academy of Higher Education. We had two journals and two seminar presentations for my second and third semesters. My journal presentations were the Match Elicitation Tool and the Network-Based Model. For my seminars, I presented on handling missing values and operation research. My final project was on Bayesian Model Comparison for Dose-Response Studies, which was even presented in GlaxoSmithKline.
